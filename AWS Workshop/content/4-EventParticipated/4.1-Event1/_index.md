- Technical session: roadmaps for modernizing VMware-based workloads to AWS (EKS, RDS, serverless).

## What I learned

- Always start from business needs, then choose appropriate technologies.
- Migration requires a clear phased roadmap rather than a big-bang approach.
- Amazon Q Developer shows promise to accelerate the SDLC and reduce manual effort.
- Security must be integrated from day one (security by design).

## Practical applications

- Run event-storming sessions to identify GenAI use cases with product teams.
- Pilot Amazon Q Developer in internal workflows to automate tests and documentation.
- Apply phased migration strategies for cloud projects.
- Integrate DevSecOps practices to ensure security across the delivery pipeline.

## Personal impressions

This was my first time attending Vietnam Cloud Day and I found it highly valuable: the CEO/CTO talks clarified market context and opportunities; panel discussions were practical and emphasized close ties between AI and business strategy; demos like Amazon Q Developer illustrated tangible productivity gains.

## Key takeaways

- GenAI is a powerful enabler but human strategy and governance remain decisive.
- A phased, measurable migration approach reduces risk and increases success probability.
- Cloud + AI can be a differentiator for Vietnamese enterprises when applied with clear roadmaps.
