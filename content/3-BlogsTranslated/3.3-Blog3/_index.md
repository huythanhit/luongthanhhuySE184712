## Introduction
In this blog post, we explore how Trianz’s Rapid Migration Offer (RMO) in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilitates seamless and efficient enterprise cloud adoption by leveraging the Concierto platform as the key enabler in streamlining and automating the entire migration process.

In the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, enterprises are constantly seeking efficient and reliable solutions to streamline their cloud adoption strategies. The VMware ecosystem has long been a cornerstone in virtualization and cloud infrastructure. With the Broadcom acquisition and increase in licensing costs, enterprises find themselves at a critical juncture to migrate and modernize their IT infrastructure swiftly and securely.

Traditional migration methods are complex, resource intensive, and fraught with uncertainty leaving organizations grappling with lengthy timelines, cost overruns, and operational disruptions. This is where fixed-price and prescriptive migration methodologies such as RMO, come into play. By providing price predictability, expert skill set, and a proven methodology for a time-bound migration, supported by automations and tooling that can orchestrate the entire end-to-end migration journey, these solutions help simplify and accelerate the cloud journey.

# Challenges in VMware migration through traditional solutions

Traditional migration methods require deep technical expertise, increasing errors and delays. Reliance on complex scripting and command-line tools can overwhelm IT professionals lacking coding skills. Limited automation necessitates manual intervention, amplifying human error. Inadequate testing capabilities and resource-intensive manual processes can lead to cost overruns and higher staffing demands. Lack of automated discovery and assessment tools in managing dependencies between applications, databases, and storage further adds complexity and error risk to the migration process. These challenges emphasize the need for a more streamlined, prescriptive, and automated approach to facilitate smoother transitions to the AWS Cloud.
# Rapid Migration Offer
Large-scale cloud migrations often face lengthy timelines and cost overruns due to a lack of specialized skills and tools, requiring development, hiring, or outsourcing. Migration projects are often structured on a “Time and Materials” (T&M) basis, leaving customers with uncertain costs and timelines, bearing the burden of delays and overruns.

To address these issues, the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) team created the Rapid Migration Offer (RMO), a prescriptive, fixed-price migration methodology designed to de-risk and accelerate enterprise-wide migrations to AWS. RMO offers several key benefits.
1.**Cost transparency** – Unlike traditional time and materials (T&M) projects, RMO clearly lays out the customer’s migration price-per-server upfront, providing cost predictability.
2. **Simplified migration strategy** – RMO provides an “easy button” for lift-and-shift portions of a migration, allowing customers to focus on modernization efforts.
3. **Turnkey migration delivery** – RMO is a prescriptive, end-to-end offering where consulting partners or AWS ProServe handle the entire migration process, including onboarding customers onto a managed services provider (MSP), if needed.
   
Trianz has collaborated with AWS to deliver RMO as a comprehensive solution for accelerating enterprise-wide migrations to AWS. By leveraging Concierto, a hyper automated zero code SaaS platform, in conjunction with RMO’s prescriptive methodology, organizations can significantly reduce the migration cycle time. For example, Concierto recently completed a large-scale VMware and Windows migration for a customer, involving more than 1,400 VMs within 4 months, encompassing rapid discovery, automated assessment, and migration execution using the RMO framework.

# Trianz Approach to RMO and Cloud Migration
Trianz’s fixed-price RMO offering leverages a team of skilled migration practitioners, the proven migration methodology that utilizes AWS migration best practices, and Concierto’s migration solution (Concierto Migrate) to deliver a highly automated and accelerated path to the cloud, across three key phases.
1.  **Assess and mobilize**
   
This phase accelerates the discovery, assessment, and planning process from months to few days. The comprehensive approach minimizes risks, optimizes strategies, and ensures efficient and cost-effective cloud adoption for enterprises.

**Automated assessment** – The migration process starts with comprehensive IT landscape discovery, identifying all assets and dependencies. The platform automatically generates detailed assessments of IT infrastructure and applications, identifying gaps using the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (Figure 1). This provides target cloud recommendations, costs, and licensing implications to support informed decision-making.

*** Migration wave planning**  – Migration tasks are grouped by related applications and infrastructure to create migration waves based on business priorities and dependencies. The platform intelligently creates the move groups based on application dependencies, enabling sequencing, effort estimation, and timeline scheduling for a clear execution plan (Figure 2).

Concierto integrates landing zone creation, configuring the target cloud environment with necessary account structures, network designs, and security controls 
2.**Migrate and modernize**
This phase enables migrations with minimal disruptions, with clear visibility and control. Automated workflows slash migration time, reduce errors, and optimize post-migration performance and cost. Concierto enables scheduled migrations with near-zero downtime and continuous data sync, allowing real-time monitoring and adjustments through migration dashboards, ensuring control over every migration phase
3.**Operate and optimize**
The operate and optimize phase helps maximize cloud investments by balancing cost-effectiveness and high performance. This includes monitoring and optimizing expenditures to ensure the AWS infrastructure is cost-effective and high performing 
# What you get out of this
**Accelerated AWS migration** – Accelerate bulk migrations to the cloud by 40% or more through pre-built catalogs and simplified workflows.
**Hybrid cloud automation and orchestration** – Manage cloud and on-premises operations through a single platform with hundreds of built-in automations.
**Consolidated hybrid cloud operations management** – Centralized lifecycle management through a user-friendly interface, eliminating the need for legacy software and reducing complexity.
**Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO)** – Up to 30% lower TCO through streamlined processes and increased automation.

**Strategic programs and offerings**
In collaboration with AWS, Concierto offers a suite of programs and offerings for customers:

1. Free combined assess and mobilize
2. Zero upfront cost migrations with the Concierto MIGRATE
3. Fixed price (per VM) Concierto MANAGE for hybrid cloud operations.
4. Net-zero dollar licensing through the AWS ISV Migration Tooling Offer.
# Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how the collaboration between AWS and Trianz offers a reliable, efficient, and simplified pathway for organizations to optimize their IT investments amid the evolving VMware landscape. The Trianz RMO leveraging Concierto addresses migration challenges by removing complexity, preventing cost overruns, and minimizing manual errors. The unified platform simplifies operations and streamlines dependency management, centralizing control to enhance visibility and enable smoother transitions with optimized performance.
