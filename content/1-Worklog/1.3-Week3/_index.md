### Week 3 — Outcomes

* Understood the role of a CDN (CloudFront) in improving website performance.
* Created and configured a CloudFront Distribution for the S3-hosted website and verified content delivery via the CDN endpoint.
* Created DynamoDB tables and practiced CRUD operations using Console and CLI.
* Deployed a simple ElastiCache Redis cluster and validated connectivity from an EC2 client.
* Integrated caching + NoSQL patterns into the static website model to improve access speed.
